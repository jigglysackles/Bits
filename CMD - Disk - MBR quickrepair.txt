Generic damaged MBR and boot sector recovery instructions for NT6 and later (Vista - 10 and Server 2008 through Server 2012)

Boot from your Windows installation media and select "repair my computer". Select the command prompt option.

Type this command

bootrec /fixboot

This writes out a new boot sector.

Next, rebuild the Boot Configuration Data (BCD)

bootrec /rebuildbcd

Next add your OS to the BCD with this command

bootrec /scanos

Clear out the MBR and write a new one...

bootrec /fixmbr

Make your fresh new boot sector something that bootmgr can understand

bootsect.exe /nt60 all /force

Restart your PC.
