VMWare convert thick provision to thin provision

This is a production server, so the utmost care must be taken.
So no downtime with a failsafe process ?
Would a 15 minutes downtime be acceptable ?
1. create additional protective snalpshot.
2. vmkfstools -i 1tb.vmdk new-thin.vmdk -d thin
3. 15 minutes downtime: attach snapshot to new-thin.vmdk and power on

4. if all is good consolidate the chain to get rid off protective snapshot
This is the approach I use when failure is no option.
That converts the vmdk from thick to thin.
If you want to do a partition resize let me know.
