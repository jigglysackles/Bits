# Gorbage Pile - Unstable, Unmaintained, Unwarranted. 
Designed to save Bits and Ends I find or make and use for my own purposes. Take what you like, but I'm not liable for anything. 

***Don't put this stuff in your production environment.***

***On your head be it, should you choose to use anything from the Gorbage Pile.***
