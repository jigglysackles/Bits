# Gorbage Pile - Unstable, Unmaintained, Unwarranted. 

<p>Designed to save Bits and Ends I find or make and use for my own purposes. Take what you like, but I'm not liable for anything. </p>

<p><em><strong>Don't put this stuff in your production environment.</strong></em></p>

<p><em><strong>On your head be it, should you choose to use anything from the Gorbage Pile.</strong></em></p>
